This repository is a great way for people to learn the Flask framework in python. It is a Basic Flask app that is great for people to learn with. I will try to keep the code well updated with comments so newbies will know exactly what is happening and why it's happening. 
The only instalation steps that are required are to make sure python is installed. You also have to install Flask with the python package manager so run 
pip install flask 
on windows or 
python3 -m pip install flask 
on mac os or linux to get the framework installed.
Once that's done, you're done with the instalation. Just run the server.py file and use the host or port command line flags if you want to change the port to something besides 80 or the host to something besides 0.0.0.0 or running on all addresses.
Have fun and learn your heart out!!!
